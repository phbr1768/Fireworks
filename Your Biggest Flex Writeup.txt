My thought process in making this was "I just want to make cool fireworks." I look up how to make a firework effect then figured out how to use trail particles from it and made a bunch more after the one.

The word I used was burst and the first thought that came to my mind was Fireworks because they are for celebration and it's the end of the semester.

There werent any inspirations for the fireworks other than ones I've seen in real life. I did look up the names for different patterns though. https://www.skybaconfireworks.com/post/12-types-of-fireworks-effects
